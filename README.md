# Network-Validation
### CSE Diploma Thesis. <br>

## Abstract
The increasing use of electronic devices that have access to the internet and the continuous app and service development on them, are constantly creating larger and more complex networks which all together are part of the greater Internet. This constant escalation and dependence of everyday life on the internet, requires from networks high quality of service, reliability, and security. But as long networks become bigger and bigger, they get more complex their management becomes harder, and the possibility of an error that can arise from human or non-human factors are increasing. To tackle this problem, automation and validation techniques have been developed. <br>
The aim of this work is to present the field of network automation and to deepen in the field of network validation or network testing. We will start by seeing the importance of networks today and the need it creates for the existence of reliable networks, next, we will present what network automation and network validation are and what its processes are, then we will present tools used today in networking by network admins and engineers and finally, we will present our tool, developed for network validation.


## Network Validation Tool
Purpose of this tool is  to make a basic simulation of a computer network. More specific, initialize a network topology, visualize the network topology and validate the network parameters.
